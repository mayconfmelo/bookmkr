# Welcome To Your Book

## Hello, World!

Congratulations! You've just created your first `bookmkr` book! As simple as that.
Now it is time to put your imagination to work and write your next masterpiece;
just create one or more _.md_ files in project root and use Pandoc markdown to
write them â€” multiple markdown files will be sorted alphabetically.

The _**bookrecipe.toml**_ file is the main configuration file, used to adapt `bookmkr`
to your needs. By default, `bookmkr` retrieves all _\*.md_ file in project root
and parses it as "_Title.epub_" in _`book/`_ directory, using
all Pandoc arguments under _`[pandoc.flags]`_ table; all options not provided
will fallback to these defaults.

The files in _`assets/`_ are used to further customize the book output: the
_`templates/`_ folder contains Pandoc templates for each output format; the
_filters.lua_ file can contain Pandoc filters; and _styles.css_ is included in
CSS-reliable output formats, such as ePub.

**If this file is in the same directory as the other source _\*.md_ files, it
will be included in the book; delete or move it to another place.**
